CoCareSync Platform Tech Stack
Frontend
React Native: Cross-platform mobile app for offline data entry and clinician workflows.
React: Web app for centralized patient data access and real-time analytics.
Tailwind CSS: Responsive, consistent styling for mobile and web dashboards.
Backend
Node.js: Scalable server-side runtime for API management.
Express.js: RESTful API framework with FHIR standards for TIER.Net, EDRWeb, NHLS, and private lab integration.
Data Integration
Python: Parse TIER.Net DDF files, EDRWeb XML exports, and NHLS/private lab data (e.g., TrakCare, DisaLab formats).
FHIR APIs: Enable seamless data exchange with TIER.Net, EDRWeb, NHLS (TrakCare/DisaLab), and private lab systems.
NHLS Integration: Connect to NHLS central data warehouse via FHIR APIs for CD4, viral load, and GeneXpert MTB/RIF results.
Private Lab Integration: Interface with private labs (e.g., Ampath, Lancet) via standardized HL7/FHIR protocols for TB/HIV test results.
AI/ML
Python: Anomaly detection (Pandas, Scikit-learn) and NLP (SpaCy) for TB/HIV data validation and risk scoring across TIER.Net, EDRWeb, NHLS, and private lab data.
TensorFlow: Machine learning for TB/HIV treatment timeline alignment and predictive analytics.
Analytics Dashboard
React: Web-based dashboard for real-time TB/HIV metrics (e.g., case finding rates, IPT uptake) from TIER.Net, EDRWeb, NHLS, and private labs.
D3.js: Interactive visualizations for trends, compliance, and high-risk group monitoring.
Chart.js: Lightweight charts for clinician and admin analytics (e.g., data completeness, error rates).
Database
PostgreSQL: Structured storage for patient records and clinical data from TIER.Net, EDRWeb, NHLS, and private labs.
MongoDB: Unstructured data (e.g., clinician notes) storage and retrieval.
Redis: In-memory caching for fast dashboard analytics and API responses.
Offline Functionality
React Native Async Storage: Cache data and queue API requests on mobile devices.
SQLite: Local database for offline storage of TIER.Net, EDRWeb, NHLS, and private lab data.
Security
HIPAA-Compliant Encryption: AES-256 for secure data transfers and storage across all systems.
Blockchain: Audit trails for data integrity and NDoH compliance.
Infrastructure
AWS: Cloud hosting for scalability, with ECS for web app deployment.
Docker: Containerization for consistent environments across mobile and web.
NGINX: Reverse proxy for load balancing and secure web app access.
Rationale
NHLS & Private Lab Integration: FHIR APIs and Python parsing connect to NHLSâ€™s TrakCare/DisaLab and private lab systems (e.g., HL7-compliant Ampath, Lancet), ensuring unified TB/HIV data (CD4, viral load, GeneXpert MTB/RIF).
Web App & Analytics: React with D3.js/Chart.js delivers real-time, interactive TB/HIV dashboards for decision-making.
Scalability: Node.js, AWS, and Redis support nationwide rollout and high-performance analytics.
Offline Support: React Native and SQLite enable functionality in low-connectivity rural areas.
Interoperability: FHIR APIs and Python parsing ensure robust TIER.Net, EDRWeb, NHLS, and private lab integration.
Security: HIPAA-compliant encryption and blockchain align with NDoH standards.
